# Combinatorial Identity Rule for the Sum of Matrix Determinants

## Introduction

This algorithm explores a fascinating property related to the sum of determinants of matrices. While directly adding the determinants of matrices A and B doesn't equate to the determinant of their sum (A + B), a captivating pattern emerges when examining the relationship between these entities. This pattern introduces an additional factor, denoted as $\(c(A, B)\)$, into the equation.

## Algorithm Overview

### 1. Basic Principle

The algorithm begins by stating that:

$$\[ \det(A + B) \neq \det(A) + \det(B) \]$$

### 2. Captivating Pattern

However, the algorithm observes a captivating pattern:

$$
\[ \det(A + B) \equiv \det(A) + \det(B) + c(A, B) \]
$$

Here, $\(c(A, B)\)$ represents the combinational arrangements of matrices A and B, either by column or by row.

### 3. Illustration with Example

To illustrate, consider matrices A and B:

$$
\[ A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \]
$$
$$
\[ B = \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{bmatrix} \]
$$

The algorithm demonstrates that:

$$\[ \det(A + B) \equiv \det(A) + \det(B) + \det\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} \end{bmatrix} + \det\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} + c(A, B) \]
$$

### 4. Verification

The algorithm verifies the equality of both sides of the equation, showcasing that the left-hand side (LHS) is equivalent to both the right-hand side (RHS) in row and column combinations.

## Extension to Larger Matrices

The algorithm asserts that this pattern holds for matrices of any size. By transforming matrices into a rank-3 tensor $\(a^{(\lambda)}_{ij}\)$, where $\(\lambda\)$ controls the terms, and considering all possible combinations of $\(\lambda\)$ values, the determinant of the sum of matrices is calculated by summing the determinants of each arrangement.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the algorithm presents a novel perspective on the relationship between the determinants of matrices and their sum, offering a unique insight into combinational arrangements. This insight extends to square matrices of varying dimensions, providing a versatile and intriguing computational approach.
